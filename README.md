# Hello-World

I'm Jennipher,

Playing with GitHub right now. Hanging out with Tulsi today, she's home for the holidays Dec 2018, Just came from her first accupunture treatment with Ki and we're about to take a hike up the mountain in Griffith Park. It's a pretty warm day in Los Angeles 71 degrees. We've got our sunglasses and sunblock and we're ready to fill our lungs with the smokey air that makes up Los Angeles right now... <a/ href="http://www.laweekly.com/calendar">Whats happening in my hometown today</a>.
